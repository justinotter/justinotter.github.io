title: About Me
---

I grew up in Oakland, California. I graduated from Haverford College in Pennsylvania in 2019 with degrees in physics and astronomy.

Some of my big interests/hobbies outside of astronomy include climbing outdoors, backpacking, and new music!

I am a proud member of <a href="https://trujhu.org">TRU-UE local 197</a>, the graduate worker's union at Johns Hopkins.
